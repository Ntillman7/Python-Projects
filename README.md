# Python-Projects

This repository contains the projects completed during my Python course for the Tech Academy Coding Bootcamp.

##Projects:
- Phonebook
- Transfer Files Gui

##Phonebook
This project functions as a phone book. It allows the user to save contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database. The user can then update or delete the entries they have previously added to the phonebook. 

##Transfer Files Gui
This project created a program that will transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All the files that are moved will be saved in a database and can easily be moved back and forth by the user between the directoryies.
