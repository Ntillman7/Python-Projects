#Purpose: Creating our first program for the Tech Academy Python Course.
#         Demonstrating how to pass variables from function to function while
#         producing a functional game.
#
#         function_name(variable) means that we can pass the variable.
#         return variable means that we are returning the variable to back 
#         to the calling function.
